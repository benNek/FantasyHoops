      title: "76ers, Hornets get together for rematch",
      news: "Dwight Howard gets a rematch with Joel Embiid when Charlotte faces the Philadelphia 76ers for the second time in five days on Tuesday night, this time on the Hornets' home court. Embiid dominated Howard in Friday's 110-99 win in Philadelphia, outscoring him 23-6 and outrebounding him 15-6. The loss was the second of what turned out to be three straight for Charlotte on a winless trip to Boston, Philadelphia and Toronto. Howard contributed just 12.3 points and 6.3 rebounds per game on the trip. That was in marked contrast to a 17.8-point, 12.2-rebound run while the Hornets were winning five straight before heading north. Howard was plagued with foul trouble in Friday's loss. Without him around to protect the rim, the 76ers shot 50.6 percent, far better than the Hornets, who struggled to 42.0 percent. If there was a positive from the game, Howard avoided allowing the frustration of the foul trouble to lead to a technical foul. In fact, he didn't get any on the trip, leaving him with 13 with 18 games to play. Should he reach 16 before the end of the regular season, he would receive an automatic one-game suspension, probably the last thing the Hornets need as they fight an uphill battle to make the playoffs. \"Obviously, he's got to be careful. I'll just leave it at that,\" Hornets coach Steve Clifford said. \"Obviously, we don't want to play any games without him. He knows that.\"The 76ers' visit begins a three-game homestand for the Hornets and ends a rugged eight-day stretch in which they'll have played the 76ers twice and the Boston Celtics and Toronto Raptors once apiece. The schedule softens significantly after Tuesday. Brooklyn and Phoenix are the other two opponents on the homestand. The Hornets do, however, still see the 76ers two more times. The teams will complete their four-game season series within a 31-day stretch. The 76ers began a four-game trip with a 118-110 loss at Milwaukee on Sunday. They had won nine of 11, including the victory over the Hornets, immediately before that. The game was the 82nd of Embiid's career, the equivalent of a full season, after he was the club's first-round pick in 2014. He has averaged 22.4 points, 9.9 rebounds and 2.0 blocks in those games, with the 76ers going 44-38. Howard, the NBA's active leader in blocks and rebounds, was the first pick of the 2004 draft by Orlando. He averaged 12.0 points and 10.0 rebounds in his first 82 games, with the Magic going just 36-46. The 82nd game was not a stellar one for Embiid on Sunday. He had seven of the 76ers' season-high-tying 26 turnovers, which the Bucks turned into 36 points. \"We may have tried to overdose trying to post Joel,\" 76ers coach Brett Brown said afterward. \"(The Bucks) turned him over and we kind of slowed down.\"Embiid began the week fifth in the NBA in turnovers per game at 3.9. Teammate Ben Simmons was next at 3.6. The 76ers lead the NBA in turnovers at 17.3 per game. The Hornets, meanwhile, have the league's third-lowest average (12.6).",

      title: "DeRozan scores 42, Raptors clinch playoff spot with OT win",
      news: "DETROIT (AP)  In the final seconds of both regulation and overtime, DeMar DeRozan pushed the ball up the court and went straight toward the basket. The first time, he threw down a dunk for the game's most spectacular highlight. Then a few minutes later, DeRozan had the ball in his hands again in a similar spot. \"I knew they would be more prone to collapse on me the next time,\" the Toronto star said. With Detroit's defenders cutting off his path to the rim, DeRozan made a simple pass to Fred VanVleet, whose tiebreaking jumper with 1.1 seconds remaining gave the Raptors a 121-119 victory over the Pistons on Wednesday night. DeRozan finished with 42 points in the overtime win, and Toronto became the first NBA team to clinch a playoff berth this season. \"We need to be hardened and face some adversity, Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. \"Tonight was one of those tests. I think each game we go into, everybody's going to give us their best shot.\" Toronto trailed by 17 in the second quarter but was able to outlast Blake Griffin and the Pistons in a back-and-forth thriller. With the score tied late in overtime, Detroit's Reggie Bullock missed an open 3-pointer with about five seconds left on the shot clock. The rebound went to DeRozan, who rushed into the frontcourt and got into the lane, where a couple defenders stood in his way. He passed to VanVleet in the left corner. Until then, VanVleet was 1 for 9 from the field, but his shot from just inside the 3-point line gave Toronto the lead. \“To win the game at the end there makes me be able to sleep a little bit better at night,\“ VanVleet said. Griffin, who had tied the game with less than a second remaining in regulation, missed a 3-pointer on the final possession of overtime. The Eastern Conference-leading Raptors have won six straight and 13 of 14. Detroit has lost four in a row and 10 of 12. Toronto's Serge Ibaka was ejected in the second quarter. After Griffin's three-point play put Detroit ahead 112-111 with 10.1 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Toronto was out of timeouts. But the Pistons lost DeRozan near midcourt, and he went all the way in for a dunk with 4.6 seconds left, drawing a foul in the process. \“We didn't do what we were supposed to do. I'm not going any further than that,\“ Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said. \“I'm not going to throw someone under the bus, but we didn't do what we were supposed to do.\“ DeRozan cut a finger, but he made the free throw to put the Raptors up by two. Griffin scored inside with 0.9 seconds left to tie it. TIP-INS Raptors: G Deion Wright left the game with a sprained big toe on his right foot, and F OG Anunoby was out with a sprained right ankle. ... Toronto trailed 59-45 at halftime before outscoring Detroit 40-25 in the third quarter. Pistons: F Stanley Johnson missed the game because of back spasms. STANDINGS Toronto leads Boston by 2  1/2 games atop the East. Detroit is now five games out of the final playoff spot in the conference. SPLIT CROWD With Detroit located right on the border with Canada, there were plenty of Toronto fans on hand, and chants of \“Let's go Raptors!\“ broke out periodically. ERRORS There were three turnovers in the final second of regulation. After Griffin's tying bank shot, the Raptors' inbound pass went out of bounds off a Toronto player around midcourt with 0.3 seconds to play. Then Griffin's long pass toward the basket went out without touching anyone, giving the ball back to the Raptors. They tried a similar long pass, but the same thing happened. \“Neither one of us had timeouts,\“ Casey said. \“Just kind of trying to give it back to each other.\“ UP NEXT Raptors: Host the NBA-leading Houston Rockets on Friday night. Pistons: Host the Chicago Bulls on Friday night.",

      title: "Covington, hot-shooting 76ers rout Hornets 128-114",
      news: "Parsons is no longer listed on the injury report for Saturday while Tyreke Evans (rib), Mario Chalmers (hamstring), and Andrew Harrison (wrist) remain sidelined. As expected, Marc Gasol will rest in the second leg of a back-to-back on Saturday after logging 32 minutes in Friday's loss. The Grizzlies have decided to not play Gasol in back-to-back games the rest of the season — something Gasol doesn't like but has accepted — according to Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal. Deyonta Davis will likely draw the start at center in his place and has been a mixed bag in his pair of starts this season, going for 22.8 and 13.5 DraftKings points. His issue has always been his foul rate as he's averaged 5.2 fouls per 36 minutes in his career, which limits his minutes upside. Davis will be squarely in the cash game mix as a punt option though at just $3800 on FanDuel opposite a Mavs side that ranks 24th in efficiency allowed to centers and dead last in rebound percentage. Dillon Brooks has seen an 11.2 percent bump in his usage rate this season with Gasol and a host of others (Mike Conley, Evans, Chalmers, Harrison) off the court and has seen a substantial bump in his DK points per 36 differential (+11.3).",

      title: "Wilson Chandler probable for Sunday.",
      news: "Chandler has been upgraded to probable for Sunday's game vs. the Kings with a sore right hip that held him out of Friday's win. He was a late addition to the injury report and coach Michael Malone stated that Chandler has been dealing with the hip injury for a significant period of time. Will Barton drew the start and produced 29.75 DraftKings points in 39 minutes, and he'll likely return to a bench role with Chandler likely back. The Nuggets have been inconsistent lately since Paul Millsap returned from wrist surgery, but over the previous two games the offense has run more through Nikola Jokic. Jokic has averaged 50.9 DK points in the last two contests while Millsap has averaged 29.4 DK points since returning despite being on a minutes restriction. The Kings present an overall positive matchup as they rank 29th in defensive rating but also play at the league's third-slowest pace this season.",

      title: "Anthony Davis a game-time decision for Sunday.",
      news: "According to coach Alvin Gentry, Davis will be a game-time decision for Sunday's contest vs. the Jazz after missing Friday's loss due to a sprained left ankle. Gentry elaborated by saying, \"I'm assuming that he will (play on Sunday). I don't know that for sure. We'll take a look tomorrow and see where he is. If he's healthy and ready to go, we'll play him. If not, we've got to line up and play.\" Davis suffered the injury during Wednesday's win after logging 23 minutes before heading to the locker room. Nikola Mirotic drew the start in his place, but the Pelicans suffered mightily in their first game without both Davis and DeMarcus Cousins (Achilles). No starter logged over 28 minutes while Darius Miller led the team with 33 minutes and Ian Clark ranked second with 32 minutes as the Pelicans lost by 19 points. Davis has recorded a FantasyLabs' +6.25 DraftKings Plus/Minus over his last 10 games despite his exuberant price tag, but he'll draw a difficult matchup against opposing big man Rudy Gobert if he's able to suit up on Sunday.",

      title: "Chandler Parsons not on injury report Saturday.",
      news: "Parsons is no longer listed on the injury report for Saturday while Tyreke Evans (rib), Mario Chalmers (hamstring), and Andrew Harrison (wrist) remain sidelined. As expected, Marc Gasol will rest in the second leg of a back-to-back on Saturday after logging 32 minutes in Friday's loss. The Grizzlies have decided to not play Gasol in back-to-back games the rest of the season — something Gasol doesn't like but has accepted — according to Ronald Tillery of The Commercial Appeal. Deyonta Davis will likely draw the start at center in his place and has been a mixed bag in his pair of starts this season, going for 22.8 and 13.5 DraftKings points. His issue has always been his foul rate as he's averaged 5.2 fouls per 36 minutes in his career, which limits his minutes upside. Davis will be squarely in the cash game mix as a punt option though at just $3800 on FanDuel opposite a Mavs side that ranks 24th in efficiency allowed to centers and dead last in rebound percentage. Dillon Brooks has seen an 11.2 percent bump in his usage rate this season with Gasol and a host of others (Mike Conley, Evans, Chalmers, Harrison) off the court and has seen a substantial bump in his DK points per 36 differential (+11.3).",

      title: "Otto Porter will play Friday.",
      news: "Coach Scott Brooks confirmed Porter will play vs. the Pelicans on Friday despite suffering a bruised right hip during the tail end of Tuesday's win. The Wizards are presently favored on the road and implied to score 110.75 points against a Pelicans teams that will likely be without Anthony Davis (ankle) and ranks first in pace since DeMarcus Cousins suffered a season-ending Achilles injury. Porter has averaged a FantasyLabs' +6.24 DraftKings Plus/Minus against teams with winning records, but if the hip becomes a hindrance, his production will likely suffer. Bradley Beal has played at least 39 minutes in three straight games, and his floor will be high after resting two days. He's provided at least 38.0 FanDuel points in six of the last seven games and averaged a team-high 7.3 assist per game.",
